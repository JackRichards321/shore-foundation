        <p>
            As technology becomes more integrated with our day-to-day activities,<br>
            it also highlights divisions of access, especially for low-income families.
        </p>

        <p>
            The simplest description of the digital divide is the gap that exists between people who have<br>
            access to modern information/technology and those who lack that access.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is not a new concept, but it has been magnified with COVID-19 and the shift to digital learning<br>
            and remote work expectations. <b> The Shore Foundation is working hard to help with that need.</b>
